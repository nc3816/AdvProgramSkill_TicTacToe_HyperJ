If you make a copy of a class that has a constructor that takes arguments,
make sure you keep at least a stub of it in your copy. It appears that a
class without a constructor gets a default one created for it , and this
will not match up.

If you make changes to your code that involve removing classes, make sure
you remove the .class files from old compilations. hyperj sees these and
uses them.

Nested classes don't merge correctly if their containing classes are in
different packages. The hyperj weaver looks at each copy of the nested
class as distinct. (This is probably due to the fact that the byte code
of nested classes is kept in separate files.) Workarounds: (1) completely
remove the nested class from one package and refer to it by the complete
name pkg.outerClass.nestedClass where "pkg" is the package where the
nested class was kept. (2) Change the design to use no nested classes.
